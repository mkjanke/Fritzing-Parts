# Fritzing-Parts
Fritzing parts, modified or created by myself. The ESP32-C3-DevkitM board was created by others, but was dimensioned wrong. I sized it to the proper dimensions and used it as a template for the ESP32-C3-DevkitC board. 

M5-Stamp-Pico was modified by me to have semi-accurate schematic and PCB views. PCB view is untested.
